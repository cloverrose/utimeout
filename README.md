utimeout
========

Run command with user time sense timeout.

 - dose not kill child process when child process is sleeping.
   - ```python demo.py sleepchild```


Implementation
==============

- polling /proc/pid/stat files.
  - inotify cannot use because /proc/pid/stat is pseudo file.
- use redis to store process ids.
  - store process id when process start in utimeout.Popen.
  - remove process id when /proc/pid/stat was deleted.
  - because redis_key is generated by uuid.uuid4(), you can run utimeout.start concurrently.
